As they continued to deliver water and other supplies to the residents suffering from the water crisis, Miller noticed that as the major media outlets began to leave, so did the help.</p><p>That night after the event in Flint, Miller got together a group of friends in his dorm room, and they discussed how they could continue to give back to the community in Flint. They settled on collecting and donating school supplies, as they realized that the water crisis had a massive impact on the development of young school-aged children.</p><p>A group of CMU students and alumni started Pack Your Back in March 2016 and were officially approved as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in May.
