				<h1>Who We Are</h1>
				
				<br>
				<p>In 2016, Central Michigan University students identified the financial burdens faced by families due to the recent economic downturns, and the underfunding of the Michigan public education system.  Pack Your Back was created by those CMU students to help supply younger students living in underprivileged locations with the proper resources to succeed in the classroom.</p>
