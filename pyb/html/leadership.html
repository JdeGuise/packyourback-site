      <h3>Taking Initiative</h3>
      <p>Pack Your Back is a nonprofit organization that was established in 2016 after organizers noticed the financial burden families have been facing after the collapse of the economy and the recent decline of the United States school system. More recently, the Flint Water Crisis has created health concerns for children in Flint, Michigan. Pack Your Back is currently working to supply the children of Flint, Michigan with the supplies needed to succeed in the classroom.</p>
 
      <p>Ever too often, parents do not put school supplies at the top of their shopping list due to other expenses that are more of a priority, such as food and heating. We are committed to providing students in need with backpacks and various types of school supplies. The only way a student can succeed in the classroom is if a they have the proper supplies to do so.</p> 
 
      <p>Pack Your Back relies on the kind donations from the community and various stores in order to provide the school supplies to the children. Since there are always more children in need, our goal this year is to donate over 500 backpacks filled with school supplies.</p>
